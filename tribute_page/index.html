      Albert Einstein developed the special and general theories of relativity, and was considered the most influential
      physicist of the 20th century. In 1921 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics for his explanation of the
      photo-electric effect.

    <h3>Quotes by Albert Einstein</h3>
    <blockquote>If I was not a physicist, I would probably be a musician. I often think in music. I live my daydreams in
      music. I see my life in terms of music... I cannot tell if I would have done any creative work of importance in
      music, but I do know that I get most joy in life out of my violin.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance you must keep moving.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live it's whole
      life believing that it is stupid.</blockquote>
